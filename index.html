    <p>Football is an outdoor game which is most popular in the world. Football is also called as “Soccer” in North America, South Africa and Australia. The name football is a combination of two words, “Foot” and “Ball” where players run and kick a big ball from their foot. Football is played between two teams and each team has 11 players in it and one of the players is a goalkeeper. There is “Goal Post” constructed at the both ends of a big ground where a big net is tied with that goalpost. Each player competes with his opponent and tries to kick the ball into opponent’s goal post which is called as “Goal”. Two goalkeepers stand in front of their team’s goal post in order to prevent the ball entering their goal post to save a goal. There is a referee in football game who judges the goal scored by a player and also ensures that the game is played honestly. The game of football is of 90 minutes with two sessions of 45 minutes each with a brake of 10 minutes. In case of no goal or equal goals, extra time of 30 minutes and finally “Penalty Shootout” of 5 attempts is given to each team.</p>
